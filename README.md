# Basic Machine Learning: 
This repository contains all the work done during summer intern at IvLabs. 
It contains:
- NumPy and PyTorch implementations of 
    - binary classifier (using sigmoid layer)
    - multiclass classifier (using softmax layer) 
- Kaggle's Titanic survival prediction challenge
